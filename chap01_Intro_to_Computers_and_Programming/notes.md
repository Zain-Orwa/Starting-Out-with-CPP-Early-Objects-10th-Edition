# Chapter 1.1 – Introduction to Computers

## 📘 Concepts

### What is a Computer?
- A computer is a **programmable machine** that:
  - Accepts input.
  - Processes data according to instructions.
  - Produces output.
  - Stores results for later use.

### General Capabilities
- **Input** → receives data (keyboard, mouse, sensors).
- **Processing** → CPU executes instructions.
- **Output** → displays or communicates results (screen, printer, speakers).
- **Storage** → saves programs and data for future use (RAM, hard drive, SSD, cloud).

### Programs and Software
- **Program** → a sequence of instructions a computer follows.
- **Software** → the collective term for programs that control the computer.
  - **System Software** → manages hardware (OS, device drivers).
  - **Application Software** → performs tasks for users (word processors, games).

### Why Programmers Matter
- Computers must be **told exactly what to do**.
- Programmers design and write instructions using **programming languages** (C++, Python, etc.).
- Without programs, hardware is useless.

## 🖥️ Example Analogy
Think of a computer like a kitchen:
- **Input** → Ingredients you bring in.
- **CPU (Processing)** → The cook following a recipe.
- **Program (Software)** → The recipe itself.
- **Output** → The meal served.
- **Storage** → Pantry or fridge where ingredients/leftovers are kept.
