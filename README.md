# Starting Out with C++: Early Objects (10th Edition)

This repository contains my **solutions, notes, and exercises** from the book
*C++ Early Objects* by Gaddis, Walters, and Muganda.

The goal is to build a structured learning resource: 
- 📚 Notes summarizing each chapter 
- 💻 Example code and exercises 
- ✅ A progressive journey from basics to advanced C++
